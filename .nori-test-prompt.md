## Test Completion Instructions

When you have completed the task above, you MUST write a status file to indicate success or failure.

**Status file path:** `/home/amol/code/nori/nori-tests/.nori-test-status.json`

**Format (JSON):**
```json
{
  "status": "success"
}
```

Or if the task failed:
```json
{
  "status": "failure",
  "error": "Description of what went wrong"
}
```

**Important:**
- The `status` field MUST be either `"success"` or `"failure"`
- The `error` field is optional but recommended when status is `"failure"`
- Write the file using: `echo '{"status": "success"}' > /home/amol/code/nori/nori-tests/.nori-test-status.json`
- Do NOT proceed with any other tasks after writing the status file
